    Screenshots

      - To generate the default screenshot, run the task/take-screenshots script.
        Make sure you add, commit, and push the generated screenshots directory
        to GitHub before previewing your app in the elementary OS AppCenter.

        (You will not be able to see your screenshots in the AppCenter preview if
        your GitHub repository is set to private. In this case, you might be able
        to get it to work by including the URL generated by GitHub when you go to
        download the image from their online interface by including the gerenated
        token. I don’t know if the token has an expiry or not.)

        If you have many localisations and screenshots, it might make sense to
        modify this script so that it saves them to a separate screenshots
        repository so as to keep from bloating your app’s repository.

        For an example of this, see Comet’s screenshots script:

        https://github.com/small-tech/comet/blob/main/task/take-screenshots#L175

      - To preview your app locally in the elementary OS AppCenter, run
        the task/preview-in-appcenter script.

      If you have localisations, the take-screenshots task will take localised
      screenshots but you will have to add them manually to this file. For an
      example of this, see Comet’s app metadata:
